                Why should you publish your story on Medium? There are many good reasons — our simple, intuitive editor, our strong domain authority, and how easy and quick it is to publish a story, for example. But one of the main reasons is that if your story is good, it has a shot at reaching a wide audience.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Unlike other platforms, you don’t need an external audience. You don’t need to know anything about SEO. Those things can certainly help, but our curation and distribution system is designed to match great stories with interested readers, so you can focus on telling your unique stories without needing those skills. Our recommendations system is built around incentivizing writers to share the deepest, richest stories.</p>
            <br />
            <p>This is in contrast to, for example, a common and infuriating format of recipe posts you find on the open web: you’re forced to scroll through page after page of nonsense to get to the actual recipe. That extra “story” is all for the sake of creating advertising space and optimizing the page to rank higher in search engines. It’s not done for the reader. This isn’t because the writer doesn’t care about the reader; it’s because the incentives are not aligned between reader, writer, and publisher.</p>
            <mark>Since we’re supported by readers, not by advertising, we have the privilege of keeping our curation focused on the reader.</mark>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>Our readers value thoughtful, nuanced, knowledgeable perspectives — we do, too</h2>
            <br />
            <p>We’re pleased to announce a new revision to our <ins>Quality Guidelines </ins>today. This revision changes little in the guidelines themselves; most of the updates are clarifications based on feedback we received from writers and editors.</p>
            <br />
            <p>If you’re new to our Quality Guidelines, welcome! These are the same guidelines used by our curation team, and describe how we assign each story we review to one of three distribution categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Network Distribution — stories that are matched to readers who are following that specific writer (and/or the publication, if the article is in a publication). This is the baseline category for any story on Medium which does not violate Medium rules. 
                </li>
                <li>General Distribution — stories that earn General Distribution are matched to readers based on their interests, and on related writers or publications they follow. These stories are also given Network Distribution.</li>
                <li>Boost — especially high-quality stories that meet our Boost Guidelines (below). These get a higher priority in being matched to readers and are also given General and Network Distribution.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>An example of writer experience versus a write-around</h2>
            <br /> 
            <p>The state of recipes — real instructions for cooking food — offers great examples of what we mean by a story that provides writer experience in the form of insight rather than filler. Compare, for example, Crispy Oven Roasted Potatoes to The Best Crispy Roast Potatoes Ever Recipe from Serious Eats.</p>
            <blockquote>What Are the Best Potatoes for Roasted Potatoes? The answer to this question is: it’s your choice. I prefer a smaller potato like the baby red or white potatoes so there are fewer cuts of the knife to make. But if you prefer, use yukon golds, sweet potatoes, or even russet potatoes, and cut them into 1-inch cubes.</blockquote>
